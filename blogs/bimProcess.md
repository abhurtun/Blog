# BIM process
## What is the problem we are trying to solve?

Today we dont have a comphensive definition for our data points aka no data catalogue.

There is not pattern to surface or save the metadata info for datapoints

## What are the outcomes?

- **BIM classification of data points, taxtonomies and business rules**
- **Complete and automated data dictionary**
- **Support IA process and deliverrables**
- **Have a pattern than is easy to implement for the CFTs**
- **Ability to ingest and derive analytic insights**
- **Ability to "self-serve" removes dependencies**
- **Minimal change to the current delivery process buy using a Templated story for the team to implement**

## Proposal

The best way to avoid dependency is not to have them in the first place!
